                <p>
                    All Cary Academy students eat together by division in the Dining Hall. Cary Academy offers a lunch designed to strengthen community and broaden student friendships. The Dining Hall staff carefully prepares all meals, paying close attention to students’ nutritional needs. Students always have a moderate amount of choice, including a salad, pasta and sandwich bar, on a daily basis. When a student has been placed on a special diet, every effort will be made to accommodate that student’s needs. A written note from a physician must be filed with the School Nurse to allow Cary Academy to plan for these accommodations.
